    <p>
        After almost 4 years of programming in Go I finally read a book about the language.
        Go <abbr title="Programming Language">PL</abbr> is just amazing because of its simplicity.
        Having even a little experience in programming one could start writing pretty decent code.
        But writing simple and readable code is always a challenge.
        What I like about this book is examples: concise & simple.

        Definitely worth reading it.
        If you're experienced Go coder you may only read chapters about Go routines, reflection and unsafe package.
