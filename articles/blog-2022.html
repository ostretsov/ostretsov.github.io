        As mentioned in the introduction, the guide is outdated: it was written in 2009.
        The article is a quick recap of what I've already read in the Go book.

        After almost four years of programming in Go, I finally read a book about the language.
        Go <abbr title="Programming Language">PL</abbr> is just amazing because of its simplicity.
        With even a little programming experience, one could start writing pretty decent code.
        But writing simple and readable code is always a challenge.
        What I like about this book is the examples: concise & straightforward.

        Definitely worth reading it.
        If you're experienced Go coder you may only read chapters about Go routines, reflection and unsafe package.
