        <h3>2022-10-28</h3>
    </hgroup>
    <p>
        I read RFC not only as a source of information but also as a source of ideas and inspiration.
        Reading RFC also clears your engineer's mind and makes you think in the correct terms.

    <p>
        Error reporting for API clients is as important as everything else in an API.
        Throughout many projects we released, we found a way to carry machine-readable details of an error:
        <pre>
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "1",
      "description": "1000000 is too big",
      "field_path": "dimensions.weight_g",
      "constraint_name": "max",
      "constraint_value": "31751"
    }
  ]
}</pre>
        That error object has machine <code>code</code>, a human-readable <code>description</code> of an error,
        <code>field_path</code> reporting a problematic field and constraints caused the error.
    </p>

    <p>
        RFC7807 (Problem Details for HTTP APIs) offers a more plain object:
        <pre>
{
  "type": "https://example.com/probs/out-of-credit",
  "title": "You do not have enough credit.",
  "detail": "Your current balance is 30, but that costs 50.",
  "instance": "/account/12345/msgs/abc",
  "balance": 30,
  "accounts": [
    "/account/12345",
    "/account/67890"
  ]
}</pre>
        The standard also encourages extending the object with extra fields, giving more context to a client.
    </p>

    <p>
        The best API guide utilizing RFC7807 is developed and supported by several Belgian government institutions:
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.belgif.be/specification/rest/api-guide/">REST Guidelines</a>.
        Worth reading.
    </p>

    <p>
        We'll try the RFC7807 error object in our upcoming projects to compare it with what we already have.

    <p>
        As mentioned in the introduction, the guide is outdated: it was written in 2009.
        The article is a quick recap of what I've already read in the Go book.

        <h2 id="finished-reading-go-pl-book">I finished reading "The Go programming language" book</h2>
        <h3>2022-10-10</h3>
    </hgroup>
    <p>
        After almost four years of programming in Go, I finally read a book about the language.
        Go <abbr title="Programming Language">PL</abbr> is just amazing because of its simplicity.
        With even a little programming experience, one could start writing pretty decent code.
        But writing simple and readable code is always a challenge.
        What I like about this book is the examples: concise & straightforward.
    </p>
    <p>
        Definitely worth reading it.
        If you're experienced Go coder you may only read chapters about Go routines, reflection and unsafe package.
