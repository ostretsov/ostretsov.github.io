        <h3>2022-12-31</h3>
    </hgroup>
    <p>
        Google team recently published the <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/go/">Go programming language style guide</a>.
        As stated, this is only early days, and work is still in progress.
        Is the style guide good enough to adopt in your team?
    </p>

    <p>
        <u>The first part</u> is about the principles behind the decisions of the style guide.
        It states the basis for the recommendations in the following two documents.
    </p>

    <p>
        <u>The second part</u> ("Style Decisions") is primarily for readability mentors.
        It's about naming variables and packages, providing examples in the documentation, formatting code conventions in Google, go routines, generics, tests, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
        After reading this part, I decided to write <a href="https://go.dev/blog/examples">examples</a> of the usage of our code.
        I also like the import grouping rule and tried <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports">goimports</a> to format imports consistently.
        It separates imports according to the recommendation into standard library packages and other (project and vendored) packages.
    </p>

    <p>
        The accent here is on readability and avoiding overthinking about performance.
        In almost all cases, readable code is preferred, and only profiling and benchmarking should be the reason to make code less readable.
    </p>

    <p>
        The style guide also recommends avoiding using assert libraries in tests, preferring more straightforward solutions for comparing values like <a href="https://github.com/google/go-cmp">go-cmd</a>.
        This approach is more flexible and, finally, even concise.
    </p>

    <p>
        <u>The third and last part</u> of the guide is <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/go/best-practices">Best practices</a>.
        It's easy to read and take on board.
        Here you'll find a lot of examples of "Good" and "Bad" code fragments.
        There are also insightful notes about "panic" and error handling.
    </p>

    <p>
        Is it worthwhile to adopt a style guide in your company?
        The short answer is "Yes."
        Should it be this style guide?
        My answer is "Yes" for our team.
        This guide is coherent, consistent, and complete.
    </p>

    <p>
        Moreover, <a href="https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/million-lines-of-code/">Google is the biggest</a> software company considering lines of code (LOC).
        In 2015 Google had more than 2 billion LOC.
        I'm sure they use the Go programming language 100% and ponder on all recommendations they give.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the next project, before committing, I will validate my code against the style guide.
        At first, it would take time.
        After a while, I will compare such code with what I had before applying these recommendations and share my experience.
    </p>

        <h2 id="belgif-rest-guidelines">Belgif REST Guidelines</h2>
        <h3>2022-11-08</h3>
    </hgroup>
    <p>
        I've finished reading <a href="https://www.belgif.be/specification/rest/api-guide/">REST Guidelines</a> by Belgif and could recommend it for review.
    </p>
    <p>
        I agree with most of the recommendations except the following.
    </p>
    <p>
        The guide recommends <i>camelCase</i> JSON field naming. Adidas, FedEx, DHL, and many more use the same style.
        We prefer (as there is no naming standard for JSON fields) <i>snake_case</i>, which is also popular and used by Facebook, Twitter, and many more companies.
        That's just our preference and Go programming language doesn't force us to use one style or another.
    </p>
    <p>
        Links to self.
        We have yet to encounter a real need to have that link.
        Linking with other resources (using the <mark>href</mark> attribute) might be helpful for the client.
        Still, a client usually saves its current state and knows where it is at the moment.
        <mark>self</mark> link looks redundant but might be used for consistency.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also got a couple of new ideas from this guide. Embedding resources look interesting.
        I don't like GraphQL, and embedding is a workaround: you may request extended data objects specifying the `embed` query parameter.
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyway, good guide stuffed with links to other valuable resources.
    </p>

        <h2 id="reading-rfc7807">Reading the RFC7807</h2>
        <h3>2022-10-28</h3>
    </hgroup>
    <p>
        I read RFC not only as a source of information but also as a source of ideas and inspiration.
        Reading RFC also clears your engineer's mind and makes you think in the correct terms.
    </p>

    <p>
        Error reporting for API clients is as important as everything else in an API.
        Throughout many projects we released, we found a way to carry machine-readable details of an error:
        <pre>
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "1",
      "description": "1000000 is too big",
      "field_path": "dimensions.weight_g",
      "constraint_name": "max",
      "constraint_value": "31751"
    }
  ]
}</pre>
        That error object has machine <code>code</code>, a human-readable <code>description</code> of an error,
        <code>field_path</code> reporting a problematic field and constraints caused the error.
    </p>

    <p>
        RFC7807 (Problem Details for HTTP APIs) offers a more plain object:
        <pre>
{
  "type": "https://example.com/probs/out-of-credit",
  "title": "You do not have enough credit.",
  "detail": "Your current balance is 30, but that costs 50.",
  "instance": "/account/12345/msgs/abc",
  "balance": 30,
  "accounts": [
    "/account/12345",
    "/account/67890"
  ]
}</pre>
        The standard also encourages extending the object with extra fields, giving more context to a client.
    </p>

    <p>
        The best API guide utilizing RFC7807 is developed and supported by several Belgian government institutions:
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.belgif.be/specification/rest/api-guide/">REST Guidelines</a>.
        Worth reading.
    </p>

    <p>
        We'll try the RFC7807 error object in our upcoming projects to compare it with what we already have.
    </p>

        As mentioned in the introduction, the guide is outdated: it was written in 2009.
        The article is a quick recap of what I've already read in the Go book.
    </p>

    <hgroup>
        <h2 id="finished-reading-go-pl-book">I finished reading "The Go programming language" book</h2>
        <h3>2022-10-10</h3>
    </hgroup>
    <p>
        After almost four years of programming in Go, I finally read a book about the language.
        Go <abbr title="Programming Language">PL</abbr> is just amazing because of its simplicity.
        With even a little programming experience, one could start writing pretty decent code.
        But writing simple and readable code is always a challenge.
        What I like about this book is the examples: concise & straightforward.
    </p>
    <p>
        Definitely worth reading it.
        If you're experienced Go coder you may only read chapters about Go routines, reflection and unsafe package.
